# -Health-Data-Insights-Predicting-Diabetes-with-Machine-Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict diabetes status based on health and behavioral data from the CDCâ€™s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. By analyzing factors such as physical activity and BMI, the model aims to identify individuals at risk for diabetes, providing insights that could aid in early detection and intervention. Key evaluation metrics, including recall and f1-score, are prioritized to ensure a balanced assessment of model performance.

* Loading the initial dataset
* Selecting desired columns
* Filtering rows based on specified criteria for each selected column
* Performing a basic exploratory analysis of the predictor and target variables
