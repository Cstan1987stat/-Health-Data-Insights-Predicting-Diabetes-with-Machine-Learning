# -Health-Data-Insights-Predicting-Diabetes-with-Machine-Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict diabetes status based on health and behavioral data from the CDCâ€™s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. By analyzing factors such as physical activity and BMI, the model aims to identify individuals at risk for diabetes, providing insights that could aid in early detection and intervention. Key evaluation metrics, including recall and f1-score, are prioritized to ensure a balanced assessment of model performance.

The initial_notebook.ipynb file includes the following steps:
* Loading the initial dataset
* Selecting desired columns
* Filtering rows based on specified criteria for each selected column
* Performing a basic exploratory analysis of the predictor and target variables

The notebook titled 'first model building process.ipynb' documents the initial fitting of three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier. The highest f1-score achieved so far is 0.48, obtained with the Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier. While this is below the desired performance, it represents a good starting point. There's significant opportunity for improvement, and I plan to explore further refinements and optimizations to enhance the model's performance.
